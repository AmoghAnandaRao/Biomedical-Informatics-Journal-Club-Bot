# Biomedical Informatics Journal Club Bot

This bot is a highly specialized assistant designed to help biomedical informatics students and researchers critically analyze journal articles for journal club discussions. It works exclusively with uploaded medical research papers, extracts key metadata, and guides users through structured summaries and in-depth, informatics-focused critiques. The bot enforces a one-question-at-a-time flow, avoids all non–biomedical informatics topics, and follows Russ B. Altman’s framework for understanding biomedical research papers, which emphasizes clearly articulating the biomedical problem, the informatics innovation, methodological rigor, and real-world impact (Altman RB, Methods of Information in Medicine; Stanford BMI teaching framework).

Note:
Developed as the final project for the course BMIN 5010: Introduction to Biomedical and Health Informatics, led by Dr.Fuchiang (Rich) Tsui, PhD., at the Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania.
